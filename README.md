# Spades RL – Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Spades (Educational Project)

This project is an **educational sandbox** designed to help better understand how neural networks can be trained through reinforcement learning — using the classic card game *Spades* as the environment.

> 🎓 This project began as a personal exploration of neural networks and reinforcement learning after the release of ChatGPT 3.5. The goal is not just to win at Spades, but to learn *how* self-play and policy optimization can lead to intelligent behavior over time.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Implements a **vectorized multi-agent training environment** where four neural networks (one per player seat) learn to play Spades.
- Uses **PyTorch** with optional **automatic mixed precision (AMP)** for GPU efficiency.
- Employs a basic **actor-critic architecture** (policy + value heads) per agent.
- Trains on multiple games simultaneously using `gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv`.
- Supports **logging via TensorBoard** and optional hotkey-based checkpoint saving.

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture

```
+-------------------------------+
|  SpadesEnv (Gym-compatible)  |
+-------------------------------+
         ⬇ (obs)
+-------------------------------+
| SeatAgent (Actor-Critic NN)  | × 4 agents
+-------------------------------+
         ⬇ (action)
+-------------------------------+
|   SyncVectorEnv (N_ENVS)     | → Parallel episodes
+-------------------------------+
         ⬅ (rewards + next turn)
```

- Each agent sees only their own hand, trick state, and game context.
- Rewards are based on trick-winning and bid accuracy.
- The agents learn entirely via **self-play**, starting from random actions.

## 📦 Dependencies

You’ll need the following Python packages (ideally in a virtualenv):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install gym numpy tensorboard
```

> ⚠️ Make sure your PyTorch install matches your GPU (this example uses CUDA 11.8).

If you're using Windows and want to enable quick-quit support (`q` to exit), no additional setup is required. On macOS/Linux, that hotkey is silently ignored.

## 🧪 Running the Training Loop

```bash
python o3_code_implementation.py
```

You should see output like:

```
Completed 100 env-episodes; last batch 157 steps
Completed 200 env-episodes; last batch 140 steps
...
```

This means 4 environments are training in parallel. Every 100 environment-episodes, a progress update is printed.

---

## 📈 Visualizing Training

You can launch TensorBoard with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

Look for scalar trends like `loss_pg`, `loss_v`, or episode count to verify training progress.

---

## 💾 Saving Checkpoints

At any time, press `q` in the terminal and the script will:

1. Save model weights to `spades_multiagent.pt`
2. Exit cleanly

To resume from a checkpoint, you can modify the script to `load_state_dict()` into each agent.

## ✍️ TODOs / Extensions

- [ ] Add a GUI or CLI to play against the bot
- [ ] Introduce better reward shaping for bids
- [ ] Enable curriculum learning or fine-tuning
- [ ] Add evaluation against static baselines
- [ ] Switch to PPO or A3C for better convergence
